# Grid_View_in_Android
Android GridView shows items in two-dimensional scrolling grid (rows & columns) and the
grid items are not necessarily predetermined but they automatically inserted to the layout using a ListAdapter.

The ListView and GridView are subclasses of AdapterView and they can be populated by binding them to an Adapter,
which retrieves data from an external source and creates a View that represents each data entry.
